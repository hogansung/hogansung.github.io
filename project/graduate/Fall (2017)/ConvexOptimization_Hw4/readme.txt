Convex Optimization Homework 4
Nov 2017 - Dec 2017
In this homework, I am working on the relationships between primal problems and dual problems, which is derived by solving Lagrange Multiplier. Among textbook problems, there are two coding problems that need to be solved with cvx package in MATLAB. Experiment results and codes are attached in the report.
