Convex Optimization Homework 1
Oct 2017 - Oct 2017
In the very first homework of this class, I first work on textbook problems, such as Voronoi sets and polyhedral decomposition, positive semidefinite cones, and properties of dual cones. Later, I am asked to find out the minimum polyhedron that can cover a sphere that is centered at (r, r, r) with radius r.
