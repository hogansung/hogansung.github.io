Operating System Homework 2
Apr 2017 - May 2017
In the first part of the homework, I elaborate the implementation details of Global Memory System (GMS). Later on, I am asked to compare the tradeoff between transparency and optimization across a few operating systems, including Sprite, Xen, and Grapevine. At the end, I compare the lazy evaluation policy between Mach, Exokernel, Xen, and VAX/VMS.
