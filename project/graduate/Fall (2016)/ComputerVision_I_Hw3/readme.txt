Computer Vision I Homework 3
Nov 2016 - Nov 2016
In this homework, we work on several topics: image warping and merging, finding optical flows (dense or sparse or iterative from coarse to fine), background subtraction, motion segmentation, and finding hough lines. For the first topic, one is basically going to repeat what we have done in last homework â€” corner detection + mapping. For second task, the horizontal and vertical gradients in image need to be calculated before solving a linear algebra problem. Later on, one can draw the optical flow on signature points, which can be found by corner detection. Both sparse optical flow or iterative from coarse to fine optical flow use similar approach. Third and fourth tasks also use similar conclusion from optical flow. The last task, hough line, on the other hand, is more interesting. Hough Transform and a threshold for peak are required. Codes are attached in the report.
