System Programming Homework 4
Dec 2012 - Jan 2013
It is the most challenging homework I encountered this semester. I am asked to calculate the smallest element given a list of numbers using multi-processes. In other words, I will fork many processes in the beginning and merge the results from them step by step. The largest obstacle for me is finding a way to process inputs from different processes synchronously. At the end, “epoll” with “non-blocking” argument sorts everything out.
