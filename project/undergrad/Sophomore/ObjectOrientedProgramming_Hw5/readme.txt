Object Oriented Programming Homework 5
Nov 2012 - Dec 2012
I am asked to create a GUI in Java to simulate three different tasks, each of which is about manipulate multiple cars on highway. This is my first time to build up a GUI, so I spent some time in reading documents. At the end, there are play/stop button and previous/next button for user to control the screen.
