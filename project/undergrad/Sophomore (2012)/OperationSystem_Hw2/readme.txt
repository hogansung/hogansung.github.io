Operation System Homework 2
Apr 2013 - Apr 2013
Students are given a small OS system called nachos, and are asked to do some changes to its OS instructions. For this homework, my teammate and I work on preserving the correct priority of threads, including replacement of readyList with SortedList. We also figure out two initial threads inside the thread queue: main thread and one thread for port.
