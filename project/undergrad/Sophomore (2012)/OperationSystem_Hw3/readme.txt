Operation System Homework 3
May 2013 - May 2013
Students are given a small OS system called nachos, and are asked to do some changes to its OS instructions. This time, I implement the functionality of multithreading in this operation system. There are multiple tricky things I need to take care of: 1) how to deal with output to screen at the same time, 2) how to allocate address space for thread, and 3) how to deal with context switch.
