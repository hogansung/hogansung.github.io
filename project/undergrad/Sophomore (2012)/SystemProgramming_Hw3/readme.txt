System Programming Homework 3
May 2013 - May 2013
In this homework, I am asked to do two things: 1) finish the functionality of my main body code and 2) compare the performance between using `fork` and `vfork`. In turns out that vfrok runs slightly faster in my experiment on my computer. However, the experiment run on work station is not stable, which might be caused by its busy status.
