Media Security Final Project - Attack a Well-Known Cloud Encryption Algorithm
Sep 2013 - Jan 2014
After some researches, my teammate and I find out that a serial of published papers use a flawed algorithm, which can be attacked, to encrypt their cloud data. To prove our correctness, we simulate the whole algorithm and crack the hidden information once we collect enough encrypted objects. Professor is really satisfied with our conclusion and encourages us to fix the problem and publish a paper about it.
