Numerical Analysis Homework 7
May 2014 - Jun 2014
In the last homework, I implement an algorithm to find out roots for any polynomial function with double-format coefficients using Newton method. The precision I can deal with in my current code is `1e-10`; however, with numerical guarantees, I believe more precise result is available.
