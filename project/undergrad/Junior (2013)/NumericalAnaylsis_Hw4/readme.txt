Numerical Analysis Homework 4
Mar 2014 - Apr 2014
Related to last homework. I am asked to continue testing the performance of `blas` library. Triple nested for loop for matrix multiplication takes around 30 minutes to finish the job; however, the pre-built optimized blas can finish the same job in around 1 minute. Other `blas` implementations, such as ATLAS and openBlas, have similar performance.
