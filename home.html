                    <h2> Some words about me </h2>
                    <p> I have decided to build one personalized website for many years, but have no time to fulfill this idea. After graduation with bachelor degree, I finally start to build my website! </p>
                    <p> For now, I have one more available year to prepare the English test and also the application. I will try to share some personal opinions to currently global-wise affairs in <a href="blog.html"><strong> Blog </strong></a>, or update my recent work or achievement in <a href="research.html"><strong> Research </strong></a> and <a href="about.html"><strong> About </strong></a>.
                    <p> I am a newbie to the website design, so there might be many room for improvements. If you have any suggestion to this website, please feel free to contact me. Several available contact approaches can be found in <a href="about.html"><strong> About </strong></a>. </p>
                    <hr>

                    <h2> Some words about website </h2> 
                    <p> This is a completely static website, which is based on bootstrap pre-built elements. There are five main webpages, includes <ul>
                        <li> <a href="index.html"><strong> index </strong></a> </li>
                        <li> <a href="home.html"><strong> home </strong></a> </li>
                        <li> <a href="blog.html"><strong> blog </strong></a> </li>
                        <li> <a href="project_undergrad.html"><strong> undergrad project </strong></a></li>
                        <li> <a href="project_graduate.html"><strong> graduate project </strong></a></li>
                        <li> <a href="research.html"><strong> research </strong></a> </li>
                        <li> <a href="about.html"><strong> about </strong></a> </li>
                    </ul> </p>
                    <p> The wepages for <a href="index.html"><strong> index </strong></a>, <a href="home.html"><strong> home </strong></a>, and <a href="about.html"><strong> about </strong></a> are easy. However, I want to elaborate my works on <a href="blog.html"><strong> blog </strong></a> and <a href="research.html"><strong> research </strong></a>. </p>
                    <h3> How to build <strong>Blog</strong> page? </h3>
                    <p> The core idea for blog is that it should at least support font-style control, and image attachment. Furthermore, there should be a main entrance for all blog articles. To achieve this requirement automatically, I decided to provide a friendly API that it takes markdown as input and generates one complete html page for article and partial html codes for preview, respectively as output. </p>
                    <h3> How to build <strong>Research</strong> page? </h3>
                    <p> The main concept for research page is to present my previous works in student projects and studies on specific topics. Thus, to illustrate my work in detail, I should provide at least <i> brief description </i>, <i> simple figure </i>, and <i> source code </i> (if possible). To fulfill the requirement with less human work, I determined to create another friendly API that it will take <i> readme </i>, <i>image</i>, <i>pdf</i>, and <i>zip files</i> (if possible) as input and generates a complete html page as output. </p>
                    <h3> How long did it take for me to build this site? </h3>
                    <p> Actually, it took me less than 10 hours to finish the wirtten codes. However, I spent more than 15 hours designing and examining possible frameworks for my website. For example, I tried SemanticUI and Json but in vain. In my following works, most of the time was spent on being familiar with bootstrap framework.

                    <h2> Future works </h2>
                    <p> Since my current website is designed for static presentation, and cannot support any dynamic-rendering techniques, I would like to alter my back-end framework first. After that, I can build my own database for comment system etc. </p>
                    <p> Possible future works are listed as follows. List order deals nothing with the priority.
